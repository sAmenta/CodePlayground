/*
Write a program that reads an unsorted list of integers and two numbers: P and M. The program needs to check whether P and M occur in the list.

The first line contains the size of the list.
The next N lines contain the elements of the list.
The last line contains two integer numbers P and M separated by a space.

If both numbers occur in the list you need to print YES, otherwise â€“ NO.
