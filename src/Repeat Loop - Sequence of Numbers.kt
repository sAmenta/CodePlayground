//You have a sequence of natural numbers that do not exceed 30000. Find the maximum element in the sequence divisible by 4.
// As input, the program first gets the number of elements in the sequence, and then the elements themselves.
// A sequence always has an element divisible by 4.
// The number of elements does not exceed 1000. The program should print a single number â€” the maximum sequence element (number) divisible by 4.
