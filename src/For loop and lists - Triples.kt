/*Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs the number of triples in the list.

A triple is three consecutive integers in ascending order â€” 3,4,5 is a triple, but 5,4,3 and 2,4,6 are not.

The first line contains the size of the list.
The rest of the lines contain the elements of the list.

Output a single integer value that represents the number of triples in the list.

In the example below, there are two triples: 4,5,6 and 5,6,7.*/

fun main() {
    val sequence = List(readLine()!!.toInt()) { readLine()!!.toInt() }
    var numberOfTriples = 0

    for (i in 0..sequence.lastIndex - 2) {
        if (sequence[i + 1] - sequence[i] == 1 && sequence[i + 2] - sequence[i] == 2) numberOfTriples++
    }
    print(numberOfTriples)
